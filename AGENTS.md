# AGENTS Instructions

- When adding a new feature, place it in a dedicated subfolder under `src/`. Create the subfolder if it does not already exist. Avoid dropping large feature implementations directly into existing node files.
- It is acceptable to use ROS dependencies outside of the `nodes/` folder when necessary, but try to avoid doing so when possible.
