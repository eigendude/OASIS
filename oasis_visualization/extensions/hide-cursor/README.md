## Hide Cursor (OASIS edition)

![Hide Cursor icon](icon.png)

Hide the mouse cursor on inactivity.

For use on Wayland, since unclutter, unclutter-xfixes and xbanish only work on X11.

Note: This initial version has a hardcoded 5 second timeout.

Adapted from the original version by [elcste](https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/elcste) for my OASIS smarthome OS (https://github.com/eigendude/OASIS).
