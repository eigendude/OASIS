# Gnome Extensions for HUD functionality

## Hide Cursor (OASIS edition)

![Hide Cursor icon](hide-cursor/icon.png)

Hide the mouse cursor on inactivity.

For use on Wayland, since unclutter, unclutter-xfixes and xbanish only work on X11.

Note: This initial version has a hardcoded 5 second timeout.
