# udev rules to grant the 'nut' group secure access to USB HID UPS devices
# so that the usbhid-ups driver (libusb backend) and any hidraw-based tools
# can communicate with all HID-class UPSes (CyberPower, APC, Eaton, etc.).

# Allow libusb (upsc/usbhid-ups) to open the USB device node for any
# USB device with at least one HID interface (class 0x03).
