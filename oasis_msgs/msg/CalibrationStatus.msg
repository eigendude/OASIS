#
# Calibration status emitted by the ROS camera_calibration pipeline while
# collecting and uploading camera intrinsics. Tracks sample accumulation,
# calibration execution, and CameraInfo publication so frontends can reflect
# progress and completion of the workflow.
#

# Number of calibration observations collected by camera_calibration's Calibrator.
# This counts each chessboard/ChArUco detection that passed the quality filters
# (spread of views, reprojection error, etc.) and is ready to contribute to the
# intrinsic solve.
uint32 sample_count

# True once the Calibrator reports that the dataset is "good enough" to solve
# for intrinsics.  The upstream camera_calibration heuristics require a diverse
# set of target poses (tilt, pan, size in frame) before this flips to true.
bool good_enough

# True after do_calibration() has successfully generated camera intrinsics and,
# for stereo rigs, the extrinsic transform.  This mirrors calibrator.calibrated.
bool calibrated

# True once the computed CameraInfo has been pushed to the camera driver via the
# set_camera_info service.  This prevents re-uploading the same calibration.
bool uploaded
